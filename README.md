# CS540-P02 Medical Diagnosis using Decision Stumps and Decision Trees

In this program, we built decision stumps and a decision tree to diagnose whether a patient has some disease based on their symptoms and medical test results using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The models will read in integer-valued patient data and output a diagnosis of whether the patient has breast cancer.
